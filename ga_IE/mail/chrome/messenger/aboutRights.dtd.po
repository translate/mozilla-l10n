# Note on pointa / pointb / pointc form:
# These points each have an embedded link in the HTML, so each point is
# split into chunks for text before the link, the link text, and the text
# after the link. If a localized grammar doesn't need the before or after
# chunk, it can be left blank.
#
# Also note the leading/trailing whitespace in strings here, which is
# deliberate for formatting around the embedded links.
