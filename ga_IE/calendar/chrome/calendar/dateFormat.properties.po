#. # In case you are looking for the note about different declensions on date
#. # formats, here it is. If your language doesn't use different declensions of
#. # month names, you shouldn't have much work. Just leave the *.monthFormat
#. # string on "nominative" and the string month.*.name will be filled in.
#. #
#. # If you need a different form for a string, you can change the 
#. # *.monthFormat to a different value. Supported values are currently:
#. #    nominative (default), genitive
#. # The modified month name form will then be filled in accordingly. If this
#. # system does not suit your needs, please file a bug!
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (month.*.name):
#. # Some languages require different declensions of month names.
#. # These values will be used if *.monthFormat is set to "nominative" or in places
#. # where using a different declension is not yet supported.

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (dayOrdinalSymbol):
#. # Allows to insert a string, a character or a symbol after the number of a
#. # monthday in order to give it the meaning of ordinal number e.g.  1 -> 1st etc.
#. # It's mainly used when formatting dates with both monthday and month name. It
#. # affects the following localizable strings that hence must be localized *without*
#. # any ordinal symbol for the monthday number:
#. #   dayHeaderLabel, monthlyDaysOfNth_day,
#. #   yearlyNthOn, daysIntervalBetweenYears,
#. #   daysIntervalBetweenMonths, daysIntervalInMonth.
#. # Write only a single string if the ordinal symbol is the same for every monthday, otherwise
#. # write a sequence of _31_ strings (one for each monthday) separated with commas.
#. # If your language doesn't require that in the mentioned strings, leave it empty.
#. # e.g.
#. # dayOrdinalSymbol=.
#. #    -> daysIntervalInMonth: 'March 3. - 9., 2008'
#. # dayOrdinalSymbol=st,nd,rd,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,
#. #                  th,th,th,th,th,st,nd,rd,th,th,th,th,th,th,th,st
