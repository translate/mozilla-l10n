#    This dialog is displayed when all of the following conditions are
#    met.
#
#    1. The user visits a page with a plugin
#    2. There is no plugin for this content type
#    3. The user has somehow removed the "default plugin" from her
#       mozilla distribution.
#
#    The "default plugin" is how we're allowing users to download plugins
#    from Netscape's plugin-finder page.  It will be shipped with NS6,
#    but as many users are in the habit of mucking about with their
#    plugins directory, it's possible they might accidentally remove the
#    default plugin.  This dialog warns them if they do so.

#    again if they remove the pref "plugin.display_plugin_downloader_dialog"
#    from their prefs file, but the dialog says nothing about this.
