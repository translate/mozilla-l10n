# #1 - replaced with the descriptive text that describes the mime type

# #2 - replaced with the mime type (e.g., "application/ms-word")
# #3 - replaced with the filename (e.g., "manual.doc")
# #4 - will be replaced by the brand name (e.g., "Mozilla")
# If there is no descriptive text, then the alternative text is used which
