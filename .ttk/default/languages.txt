# Language names mappings
#
# The language mappings file stores the upstream, Pootle and aliases for given
# languages.  This allows the tools to accept any form and still know the
# correct language name.
#
# This file IS NOTE a list of all languages, only those that need mappings.
# Tools are designed such that if a language mapping is not found then the
# queried language is returned unchanged.
#
# Mappings are usually of the form:
#    xx-YY -> xx
#    xx-YY -> xx_YY
#
# Aliases allow for the storing of obsolete, more correct or other names:
#    hi-IN -> hi
#
# The file is tab delimetted in the form:
#    # Comment
#    Pootle Name[\t]Upstream Name[\t]Aliases
#
# Aliases are optional.
