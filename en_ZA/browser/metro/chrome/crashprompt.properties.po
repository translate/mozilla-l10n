"Firefox has a crash-reporting feature that sends a report to Mozilla when "
"Firefox crashes. Mozilla uses information in crash reports to diagnose and "
"correct problems in Firefox that cause crashes. Though this feature starts "
"automatically after Firefox crashes, it does not send information to Mozilla "
"until you explicitly authorize it to do so. By default, this feature sends a "
"variety of Non-Personal Information to Mozilla, including the stack trace (a "
"detailed description of which parts of the Firefox code were active at the "
"time of the crash) and the type of computer you are using. Additional "
"information is collected by the crash reporting feature. Which crash "
"reporting feature is used and what additional information collected by "
"Firefox depends on which version of Firefox you are using."
