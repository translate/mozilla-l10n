#. # Printing error messages.
#. #LOCALIZATION NOTE: Some of these messages come in pairs, one
#. # for printing and one for print previewing.  You can remove that
#. # distinction in your language by removing the entity with the _PP
#. # suffix; then the entity without a suffix will be used for both.
#. # You can also add that distinction to any of the messages that don't
#. # already have it by adding a new entity with a _PP suffix.

#. # printing, and PERR_FAILURE_PP will be used under the same conditions
