#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside the Web Console
#. # command line which is available from the Web Developer sub-menu
#. # -> 'Web Console'.
#. # The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in
#. # English, or another language commonly spoken among web developers.
#. # You want to make that choice consistent across the developer tools.
#. # A good criteria is the language in which you'd find the best
#. # documentation on web development on the web.
#. # For each command there are in general two strings. As an example consider
#. # the 'pref' command.
#. # commandDesc (e.g. prefDesc for the command 'pref'): this string contains a
#. # very short description of the command. It's designed to be shown in a menu
#. # alongside the command name, which is why it should be as short as possible.
#. # commandManual (e.g. prefManual for the command 'pref'): this string will
#. # contain a fuller description of the command. It's diplayed when the user
#. # asks for help about a specific command (e.g. 'help pref').
