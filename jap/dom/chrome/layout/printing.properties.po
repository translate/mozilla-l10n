#. # Printing error messages.
#. #LOCALIZATION NOTE: Some of these messages come in pairs, one
#. # for printing and one for print previewing.  You can remove that
#. # distinction in your language by removing the entity with the _PP
#. # suffix; then the entity without a suffix will be used for both.
#. # You can also add that distinction to any of the messages that don't
#. # already have it by adding a new entity with a _PP suffix.
#. #
#. # For instance, if you delete PERR_GFX_PRINTER_DOC_IS_BUSY_PP, then
#. # the PERR_GFX_PRINTER_DOC_IS_BUSY message will be used for that error
#. # condition when print previewing as well as when printing.  If you
#. # add PERR_FAILURE_PP, then PERR_FAILURE will only be used when
#. # printing, and PERR_FAILURE_PP will be used under the same conditions
#. # when print previewing.
