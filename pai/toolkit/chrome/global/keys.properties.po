#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE : FILE This file contains the application's labels for keys on the keyboard.
#. #                     If you decide to translate this file, you should translate it based on
#. #                     the prevelant kind of keyboard for your target user.
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE : There are two types of keys, those w/ text on their labels
#. #                     and those w/ glyphs.
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE : VK_<…> represents a key on the keyboard.
#. #
#. # For more information please see bugzilla bug 90888.
#. # F1..F10 should probably not be translated unless there are keyboards that actually have other labels
#. # F11..F20 might be something else, but are really keyboard specific and not region/language specific
#. # there are actually two different F11/F12 keys, I don't know which one these labels represent.
#. # eg, F13..F20 on a sparc keyboard are labeled Props, Again .. Find, Cut
#. # sparc also has Stop, Again and F11/F12. VK_F11/VK_F12 probably map to Stop/Again
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE : BLOCK Do not translate the next block
