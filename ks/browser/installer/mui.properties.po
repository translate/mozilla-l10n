#. # To make the l10n tinderboxen see changes to this file you can change a value
#. # name by adding - to the end of the name followed by chars (e.g. Branding-2).
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE:
#. # This file must be saved as UTF8
#. # Accesskeys are defined by prefixing the letter that is to be used for the
#. # accesskey with an ampersand (e.g. &).
#. # Do not replace $BrandShortName, $BrandFullName, or $BrandFullNameDA with a
#. # custom string and always use the same one as used by the en-US files.
#. # $BrandFullNameDA allows the string to contain an ampersand (e.g. DA stands
#. # for double ampersand) and prevents the letter following the ampersand from
#. # being used as an accesskey.
#. # You can use \n to create a newline in the string but only when the string
#. # from en-US contains a \n.
