#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE These strings are used inside Device Emulation developer
#. # tools. The correct localization of this file might be to keep it in English,
#. # or another language commonly spoken among web developers.  You want to make
#. # that choice consistent across the developer tools.  A good criteria is the
#. # language in which you'd find the best documentation on web development on the
#. # web.
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE:
#. # These strings are category names in a list of devices that a user can choose
#. # to simulate (e.g. "ZTE Open C", "VIA Vixen", "720p HD Television", etc).
