#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (*.facetLabel): These are the labels used to label the facet
#. #  displays in the global search facet display mechanism.
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (*.includeLabel): The label to use for the included group
#. #  in the facet display.  If not provided, we will fall back to
#. #  "glodaFacetView.facets.included.fallbackLabel".
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (*.excludeLabel): The label to use for the excluded group
#. #  in the facet display.  If not provided, we will fall back to
#. #  "glodaFacetView.facets.excluded.fallbackLabel".
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (*.remainderLabel): The label to use for the remaining items
#. #  that are neither part of the included group or the excluded group in the
#. #  facet display.  If not provided, we will fall back to
#. #  "glodaFacetView.facets.remainder.fallbackLabel".
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.folder.*): Stores the message folder in
#. #  which the message is stored.
#: gloda.message.attr.folder.facetLabel
msgid "Mail Folder"
msgstr "Pasta de correio"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.fromMe.*): Stores everyone involved
#. #  with the message.  This means from/to/cc/bcc.
#: gloda.message.attr.fromMe.facetLabel
msgid "From Me"
msgstr "De mim"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.toMe.*): Stores everyone involved
#. #  with the message.  This means from/to/cc/bcc.
#: gloda.message.attr.toMe.facetLabel
msgid "To Me"
msgstr "Para mim"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.involves.*): Stores everyone involved
#. #  with the message.  This means from/to/cc/bcc.
#: gloda.message.attr.involves.facetLabel
msgid "People"
msgstr "Pessoas"

#: gloda.message.attr.involves.includeLabel
msgid "involving any of:"

msgstr "não envolve:"

#: gloda.message.attr.involves.remainderLabel
msgid "other participants:"
msgstr "outros participantes:"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.date.*): Stores the date of the message.
#. #  SeaMonkey normally stores the date the message claims it was composed
#. #  according to the "Date" header.  This is not the same as when the message
#. #  was sent or when it was eventually received by the user.  In the future we
#. #  may change this to be one of the other dates, but not anytime soon.
#: gloda.message.attr.date.facetLabel
msgid "Date"
msgstr "Data"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.attachmentTypes.*): Stores the list of
#. #  MIME types (ex: image/png, text/plain) of real attachments (not just part of
#. #  the message content but explicitly named attachments) on the message.
#. #  Although we hope to be able to provide localized human-readable explanations
#. #  of the MIME type (ex: "PowerPoint document"), I don't know if that is going
#. #  to happen.
#: gloda.message.attr.attachmentTypes.facetLabel
msgid "Attachments"
msgstr "Anexos"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.mailing-list.*): Stores the mailing
#. #  lists detected in the message.  This will normally be the e-mail address of
#. #  the mailing list and only be detected in messages received from the mailing
#. #  list.  Extensions may contribute additional detected mailing-list-like
#. #  things.
#: gloda.message.attr.mailing-list.facetLabel
msgid "Mail List Involved"
msgstr "Lista de correio envolvida"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.tag.*): Stores the tags applied to the
#. #  message.  Notably, gmail's labels are not currently exposed via IMAP and we
#. #  do not do anything clever with gmail, so this is indepdendent of gmail
#. #  labels.  This may change in the future, but it's a safe bet it's not
#. #  happening on SeaMonkey's side prior to 2.0.
#: gloda.message.attr.tag.facetLabel
msgid "Tags"
msgstr "Etiquetas"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.star.*): Stores whether the message is
#. #  flagged or not, as indicated by a pretty flag icon.
#. #  Thunderbird uses a star.
#: gloda.message.attr.star.facetLabel
msgid "Flagged"
msgstr "Com estrela"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.read.*): Stores whether the user has
#. #  read the message or not.
#: gloda.message.attr.read.facetLabel
msgid "Read"
msgstr "Lido"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.repliedTo.*): Stores whether we believe
#. #  the user has ever replied to the message.  We normally show a little icon in
#. #  the thread pane when this is the case.
#: gloda.message.attr.repliedTo.facetLabel
msgid "Replied"
msgstr "Respondido para"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.message.attr.forwarded.*): Stores whether we believe
#. #  the user has ever forwarded the message.  We normally show a little icon in
#. #  the thread pane when this is the case.
#: gloda.message.attr.forwarded.facetLabel
msgid "Forwarded"
msgstr "Reencaminhado"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.*.label): Map categories of MIME
#. #  types defined in mimeTypeCategories.js to labels.
#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.archives.label): Archive is
#. #  referring to things like zip files, tar files, tar.gz files, etc.
#: gloda.mimetype.category.archives.label
msgid "Archives"
msgstr "Arquivos"

#: gloda.mimetype.category.documents.label
msgid "Documents"
msgstr "Documentos"

#: gloda.mimetype.category.images.label
msgid "Images"
msgstr "Imagens"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.media.label): Media is meant to
#. #  encompass both audio and video.  This is because video and audio streams are
#. #  frequently stored in the same type of container and we cannot rely on the
#. #  sending e-mail client to have been clever enough to figure out what was
#. #  really in the file.  So we group them together.
#: gloda.mimetype.category.media.label
msgid "Media (Audio, Video)"
msgstr "Multimédia (áudio, vídeo)"

#: gloda.mimetype.category.pdf.label
msgid "PDF Files"
msgstr "Ficheiros PDF"

#. # LOCALIZATION NOTE (gloda.mimetype.category.other.label): Other is the category
#. #  for MIME types that we don't really know what it is.
#: gloda.mimetype.category.other.label
msgid "Other"
msgstr "Outro"
