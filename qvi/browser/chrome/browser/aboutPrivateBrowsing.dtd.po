#. Width of the Private Browsing section. This should depend primarily on the
#. length of the headers and text, but should be roughly 1.5 times the width
#. of the Tracking Protection section, and in general not much larger than
#. 30em to prevent the sections from wrapping on smaller window sizes.

#. Width of the Tracking Protection section. It is fine for the enabled or
#. disabled indicator or the words in the title to wrap to the next line, but
#. you can expand or reduce this section to fit better, as long as the width
#. of the Private Browsing section is roughly 1.5 times the width of this one.
#. Note that the required space may vary between platforms because fonts are
#. different, so testing on Windows, Mac, and Linux is encouraged.
